    # Opens a connection to the X server that controls a display.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **name** Specifies the hardware display name, which determines the display and communications domain to be used.
    # On a `POSIX`-conformant system, if the `name` is *nil*, it defaults to the value of the `DISPLAY` environment variable.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The encoding and interpretation of the display name is implementation dependent.
    # Strings in the `Host Portable Character Encoding` are supported;
    # support for other characters is implementation dependent. On `POSIX`-conformant systems,
    # the display name or `DISPLAY` environment variable can be a string in the format:
    # ```text
    # hostname:number.screen_number
    # ```
    # - **hostname** Specifies the name of the host machine on which the display is physically attached.
    # You follow the hostname with either a single colon (:) or a double colon (::).
    # - **number** Specifies the number of the display server on that host machine.
    # You may optionally follow this display number with a period (.).
    # A single CPU can have more than one display. Multiple displays are usually numbered starting with zero.
    # - **screen_number** Specifies the screen to be used on that server.
    # Multiple screens can be controlled by a single X server. The screen_number sets an internal
    # variable that can be accessed by using the `default_screen` function.
    # For example, the following would specify screen 1 of display 0 on the machine named *dual-headed*:
    # ```text
    # dual-headed:0.1
    # ```

    # ###Description
    # `close` function closes the connection to the X server for the display
    # specified in the Display structure and destroys all windows, resource IDs
    # (`X11::C::Window`, `X11::C::Font`, `X11::C::Pixmap`, `X11::C::Colormap`,
    # `X11::C::Cursor`, and `GContext`), or other resources that the client has
    # created on this display, unless the close-down mode of the resource has
    # been changed (see `set_close_down_mode`). Therefore, these windows, resource IDs,
    # and other resources should never be referenced again or an error will be generated.
    # Before exiting, you should call `close` explicitly so that any pending
    # errors are reported as `close` performs a final `sync` operation.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # `close` can generate a **BadGC** error.

    # ###Description
    # `load_query_font` function provides the most common way for accessing a font.
    # `load_query_font` both opens (loads) the specified font and returns a pointer

    # ###Description
    # The `query_font` function returns a `FontStruct` structure, which contains
    # information associated with the font. You can query a font or the font stored in a GC.
    # The font ID stored in the `FontStruct` structure will be the `GContext` ID,

    # Creates an `Image`.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **visual** Specifies the `Visual` structure.
    # - **depth** Specifies the depth of the image.
    # - **format** Specifies the format for the image. You can pass **XYBitmap**, **XYPixmap**, or **ZPixmap**.
    # - **offset** Specifies the number of pixels to ignore at the beginning of the scanline.
    # - **data** Specifies the image data.
    # - **width** Specifies the width of the image, in pixels.
    # - **height** Specifies the height of the image, in pixels.
    # - **bitmap_pad** Specifies the quantum of a scanline (8, 16, or 32).
    # In other words, the start of one scanline is separated in client memory
    # from the start of the next scanline by an integer multiple of this many bits.
    # - **bytes_per_line** Specifies the number of bytes in the client image between
    # the start of one scanline and the start of the next.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `create_image` function allocates the memory needed for an `Image` structure
    # for the specified display but does not allocate space for the image itself.
    # Rather, it initializes the structure byte-order, bit-order, and bitmap-unit
    # values from the display and returns a pointer to the `Image` structure.
    # The red, green, and blue mask values are defined for Z format images only
    # and are derived from the `Visual` structure passed in. Other values also
    # are passed in. The offset permits the rapid displaying of the image without
    # requiring each scanline to be shifted into position. If you pass a zero
    # value in bytes_per_line, Xlib assumes that the scanlines are contiguous
    # in memory and calculates the value of *bytes_per_line* itself.
    #
    # Note that when the image is created using `create_image`, `get_image`, or
    # `Image::sub_image`, the destroy procedure that the `Image::finalize`
    # function calls frees both the image structure and the data pointed to by the image structure.

    # This function specifically supports rudimentary screen dumps.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **d** Specifies the drawable.
    # - **x**, **y** Specify the *x* and *y* coordinates, which are relative to the origin of the drawable and define the upper-left corner of the rectangle.
    # - **width**, **height** Specify the *width* and *height* of the subimage, which define the dimensions of the rectangle.
    # - **plane_mask** Specifies the plane mask.
    # - **format** Specifies the format for the image. You can pass **XYPixmap** or **ZPixmap** .
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `get_image` function returns an Image object.
    # This object provides you with the contents of the specified rectangle of the drawable in the format you specify.
    # If the `format` argument is **XYPixmap** , the image contains only the bit planes you passed to the plane_mask argument.
    # If the plane_mask argument only requests a subset of the planes of the display,
    # the depth of the returned image will be the number of planes requested.
    # If the format argument is **ZPixmap** , `get_image` returns as zero the bits in all planes not specified in the `plane_mask` argument.
    # The function performs no range checking on the values in `plane_mask` and ignores extraneous bits.
    #
    # `get_image` returns the depth of the image to the depth member of the Image object.
    # The depth of the image is as specified when the drawable was created,
    # except when getting a subset of the planes in **XYPixmap** format,
    # when the depth is given by the number of bits set to 1 in `plane_mask`.
    #
    # If the drawable is a *pixmap*, the given rectangle must be wholly contained within the pixmap,
    # or a **BadMatch** error results. If the drawable is a *window*,
    # the window must be viewable, and it must be the case that if there were no inferiors or overlapping windows,
    # the specified rectangle of the window would be fully visible on the screen and wholly contained within the outside edges of the window,
    # or a **BadMatch** error results. Note that the borders of the window can be included and read with this request.
    # If the window has backing-store, the backing-store contents are returned for regions of the window that are obscured by noninferior windows.
    # If the window does not have backing-store, the returned contents of such obscured regions are undefined.
    # The returned contents of visible regions of inferiors of a different depth than the specified window's depth are also undefined.
    # The pointer cursor image is not included in the returned contents. If a problem occurs, `get_image` raises exception.
    #
    # `get_image` can generate **BadDrawable** , **BadMatch** , and **BadValue** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostic
    # - **BadDrawable** A value for a `Drawable` argument does not name a defined `Window` or `Pixmap`.
    # - **BadMatch** An `InputOnly` window is used as a `Drawable`.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
    # Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is accepted.
    # Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    # - **width**, **height** Specify the *width* and *height* of the subimage, which define the dimensions of the rectangle.
    # - **plane_mask** Specifies the plane mask.
    # - **format** Specifies the format for the image. You can pass **XYPixmap** or **ZPixmap**.
    # - **dest_image** Specifies the destination image.
    # - **dest_x**, **dest_y** Specify the *x* and *y* coordinates, which are relative to the origin of the destination rectangle, specify its upper-left corner, and determine where the subimage is placed in the destination image.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `sub_image` function updates *dest_image* with the specified subimage in the same manner as `image`.
    # If the *format* argument is **XYPixmap**, the image contains only the bit planes you passed to the *plane_mask* argument.
    # If the *format* argument is **ZPixmap** , #get_sub_image returns as zero the bits in all planes not specified in the *plane_mask* argument.
    # The function performs no range checking on the values in *plane_mask* and ignores extraneous bits.
    # As a convenience, `sub_image` returns an image object specified by *dest_image*.
    # The depth of the destination `Image` object must be the same as that of the drawable.
    # If the specified subimage does not fit at the specified location on the destination image,
    # the right and bottom edges are clipped. If the drawable is a *pixmap*,
    # the given rectangle must be wholly contained within the *pixmap*,
    # or a **BadMatch** error results. If the drawable is a *window*,
    # the window must be viewable, and it must be the case that if there were no inferiors or overlapping windows,
    # the specified rectangle of the window would be fully visible on the screen and wholly contained within the outside edges of the window,
    # or a **BadMatch** error results. If the window has backing-store,
    # then the backing-store contents are returned for regions of the window that are obscured by noninferior windows.
    # If the window does not have backing-store, the returned contents of such obscured regions are undefined.
    # The returned contents of visible regions of inferiors of a different depth than the specified window's depth are also undefined.
    # If a problem occurs, `sub_image` raises exception.
    #
    # `sub_image` can generate **BadDrawable**, **BadGC**, **BadMatch**, and **BadValue** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadDrawable** A value for a *Drawable* argument does not name a defined *Window* or *Pixmap*.
    # - **BadGC** A value for a *GContext* argument does not name a defined *GContext*.

    # Creates a colormap
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **colormap** Specifies the colormap.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `copy_colormap_and_free` function creates a colormap of the same visual
    # type and for the same screen as the specified colormap and returns the new colormap ID.
    # It also moves all of the client's existing allocation from the specified colormap to the new
    # colormap with their color values intact and their read-only or writable characteristics
    # intact and frees those entries in the specified colormap. Color values
    # in other entries in the new colormap are undefined. If the specified
    # colormap was created by the client with alloc set to **AllocAll**,
    # the new colormap is also created with **AllocAll**, all color values
    # for all entries are copied from the specified colormap, and then all
    # entries in the specified colormap are freed. If the specified colormap
    # was not created by the client with **AllocAll**, the allocations to be
    # moved are all those pixels and planes that have been allocated by the
    # client using `alloc_color`, `alloc_named_color`, `alloc_color_cells`,
    # or `alloc_color_planes` and that have not been freed since they were allocated.
    #
    # `copy_colormap_and_free` can generate **BadAlloc** and **BadColor** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAlloc** The server failed to allocate the requested source or server memory.
    # - **BadColor** A value for a `Colormap` argument does not name a defined `Colormap`.

    # Creates a colormap
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **w** Specifies the window on whose screen you want to create a colormap.
    # - **visual** Specifies a visual type supported on the screen. If the visual type is not one supported by the screen, a **BadMatch** error results.
    # - **alloc** Specifies the colormap entries to be allocated. You can pass **AllocNone** or **AllocAll**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `create_colormap` function creates a colormap of the specified visual type
    # for the screen on which the specified window resides and returns the colormap ID#
    # associated with it. Note that the specified window is only used to determine the screen.
    #
    # The initial values of the colormap entries are undefined for the visual classes
    # *GrayScale*, *PseudoColor*, and *DirectColor*. For *StaticGray*, *StaticColor*,
    # and `TrueColor`, the entries have defined values, but those values are specific
    # to the visual and are not defined by X. For *StaticGray*, *StaticColor*, and *TrueColor*,
    # alloc must be **AllocNone**, or a **BadMatch** error results. For the other visual classes,
    # if alloc is **AllocNone**, the colormap initially has no allocated entries,
    # and clients can allocate them.
    #
    # If alloc is **AllocAll the entire colormap is allocated writable.
    # The initial values of all allocated entries are undefined.
    # For *GrayScale* and *PseudoColor*, the effect is as if an `alloc_color_cells` call returned
    # all pixel values from zero to `N - 1`, where `N` is the colormap entries value in the specified visual.
    # For *DirectColor*, the effect is as if an `alloc_color_planes` call returned a
    # pixel value of zero and red_mask, green_mask, and blue_mask values containing the same
    # bits as the corresponding masks in the specified visual. However, in all cases,
    # none of these entries can be freed by using `free_colors`.
    #
    # `create_colormap` can generate **BadAlloc**, **BadMatch**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAlloc** The server failed to allocate the requested source or server memory.
    # - **BadMatch** An *InputOnly* window is used as a *Drawable*.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
    # - **BadPixmap** A value for a *Pixmap* argument does not name a defined *Pixmap*.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
    # Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is accepted.
    # Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
    # - **BadWindow** A value for a Window argument does not name a defined *Window*.

    # Creates a cursor.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **source** Specifies the shape of the source cursor.
    # - **mask** Specifies the cursor's source bits to be displayed or **None**.
    # - **foreground_color** Specifies the RGB values for the foreground of the source.
    # - **background_color** Specifies the RGB values for the background of the source.
    # - **x**, **y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which indicate the hotspot relative to the source's origin.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `create_pixmap_cursor` function creates a cursor and returns the cursor ID associated with it.
    # The foreground and background RGB values must be specified using *foreground_color* and *background_color*,
    # even if the X server only has a *StaticGray* or *GrayScale* screen.
    # The foreground color is used for the pixels set to 1 in the source,
    # and the background color is used for the pixels set to 0. Both source and mask,
    # if specified, must have depth one (or a **BadMatch** error results) but can have any root.
    # The mask argument defines the shape of the cursor. The pixels set to 1 in
    # the mask define which source pixels are displayed, and the pixels set to 0
    # define which pixels are ignored. If no mask is given, all pixels of the
    # source are displayed. The mask, if present, must be the same size as the
    # pixmap defined by the source argument, or a **BadMatch** error results.
    # The hotspot must be a point within the source, or a **BadMatch** error results.
    #
    # The components of the cursor can be transformed arbitrarily to meet display limitations.
    # The pixmaps can be freed immediately if no further explicit references to
    # them are to be made. Subsequent drawing in the source or mask pixmap has
    # an undefined effect on the cursor. The X server might or might not make a copy of the pixmap.
    #
    # `create_pixmap_cursor` can generate **BadAlloc** and **BadPixmap** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAlloc** The server failed to allocate the requested source or server memory.

    # Creates a cursor.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **source_font** Specifies the font for the source glyph.
    # - **mask_font** Specifies the font for the mask glyph or **None**.
    # - **source_char** Specifies the character glyph for the source.
    # - **mask_char-** Specifies the glyph character for the mask.
    # - **foreground_color** Specifies the RGB values for the foreground of the source.
    # - **background_color** Specifies the RGB values for the background of the source.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `create_glyph_cursor` function is similar to `create_pixmap_cursor`
    # except that the source and mask bitmaps are obtained from the specified font glyphs.
    # The source_char must be a defined glyph in *source_font*, or a **BadValue** error results.
    # If *mask_font* is given, mask_char must be a defined glyph in *mask_font*, or a **BadValue** error results.
    # The *mask_font* and character are optional. The origins of the *source_char* and *mask_char*
    # (if defined) glyphs are positioned coincidently and define the hotspot.
    # The source_char and mask_char need not have the same bounding box metrics,
    # and there is no restriction on the placement of the hotspot relative to the bounding boxes.
    # If no mask_char is given, all pixels of the source are displayed. You can
    # free the fonts immediately by calling `free_font` if no further explicit references to them are to be made.
    #
    # For 2-byte matrix fonts, the 16-bit value should be formed with the byte1
    # member in the most-significant byte and the byte2 member in the least-significant byte.
    #
    # `create_glyph_cursor` can generate **BadAlloc**, **BadFont**, and **BadValue** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAlloc** 	The server failed to allocate the requested source or server memory.
    # - **BadFont** A value for a font argument does not name a defined font (or, in some cases, `GContext`).
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.

    # ###Description
    # X provides a set of standard cursor shapes in a special font named cursor.
    # Applications are encouraged to use this interface for their cursors because
    # the font can be customized for the individual display type.
    # The shape argument specifies which glyph of the standard fonts to use.

    # Loads the specified font
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **name** Specifies the name of the font, which is a string.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `load_font` function loads the specified font and returns its
    # associated font ID. If the font name is not in the Host Portable Character Encoding,
    # the result is implementation dependent. Use of uppercase or lowercase does not matter.
    # When the characters "?" and "*" are used in a font name, a pattern match
    # is performed and any matching font is used. In the pattern, the "?" character
    # will match any single character, and the "*" character will match any number of characters.
    # A structured format for font names is specified in the X Consortium standard
    # **X Logical Font Description Conventions**. If `load_font` was unsuccessful at loading the specified font,
    # a **BadName** error results. Fonts are not associated with a particular
    # screen and can be stored as a component of any `X11::C::X::GC`.
    # When the font is no longer needed, call `unload_font`.
    #
    # `load_font` can generate **BadAlloc** and **BadName** errors.

    # - **depth** Specifies the window's depth. A depth of **CopyFromParent** means the depth is taken from the parent.
    # - **parent** Specifies the parent window.
    # - **valuemask** Specifies which window attributes are defined in the attributes argument.
    # This mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid attribute mask bits. If valuemask is zero, the attributes are ignored and are not referenced.
    # - **visual**Specifies the visual type. A visual of **CopyFromParent** means the visual type is taken from the parent.
    # - **width**, **height** Specify the width and height, which are the created window's inside dimensions and do not include the created window's borders
    # - **x**, **y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which are the top-left outside corner of the window's borders and are relative to the inside of the parent window's borders.
    #
    # ###Description

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `keyboard_mapping` function returns the symbols for the specified

    # Allocates color planes.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **colormap** Specifies the colormap.
    # - **contig** Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the planes must be contiguous.
    # - **ncolors** Specifies the number of pixel values that are to be returned in the pixels_return array.
    # - **nreds**, **ngreens**, **nblues** Specify the number of red, green, and blue planes. The value you pass must be nonnegative.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The specified ncolors must be positive; and nreds, ngreens, and nblues must be nonnegative,
    # or a **BadValue** error results. If ncolors colors, nreds reds, ngreens greens,
    # and nblues blues are requested, ncolors pixels are returned; and the masks have
    # nreds, ngreens, and nblues bits set to 1, respectively. If contig is **true**,
    # each mask will have a contiguous set of bits set to 1. No mask will have
    # any bits set to 1 in common with any other mask or with any of the pixels.
    # For **DirectColor**, each mask will lie within the corresponding pixel subfield.
    # By **ORing** together subsets of masks with each pixel value, `ncolors * 2^(nreds+ngreens+nblues)`
    # distinct pixel values can be produced. All of these are allocated by the request.
    # However, in the colormap, there are only `ncolors * 2^nreds` independent red entries,
    # `ncolors * 2^ngreens` independent green entries, and `ncolors * 2^nblues`
    # independent blue entries. This is true even for **PseudoColor**. When the
    # colormap entry of a pixel value is changed (using `store_colors`, `store_color`,
    # or `store_named_color`), the pixel is decomposed according to the masks,
    # and the corresponding independent entries are updated. `alloc_color_planes` returns
    # nonzero if it succeeded or zero if it failed.
    #
    # `alloc_color_planes` can generate **BadColor** and **BadValue** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadColor** A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Colormap.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
    # by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
    # full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    # Looks up the named color with respect to the screen that is associated with the specified colormap.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **colormap** Specifies the colormap.
    # - **color_name** Specifies the color name string (for example, red) whose color definition structure you want returned.
    #
    # ###Return
    # - **screen_def** The closest RGB values provided by the hardware.
    # - **exact_def** The exact RGB values.
    # - **status** Nonzero if a cell is allocated; otherwise, it is zero.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `alloc_named_color` function looks up the named color with respect to
    # the screen that is associated with the specified colormap. It returns both
    # the exact database definition and the closest color supported by the screen.
    # The allocated color cell is read-only. The pixel value is returned in
    # screen_def. If the color name is not in the Host Portable Character Encoding,
    # the result is implementation dependent. Use of uppercase or lowercase does not matter.
    # If screen_def and exact_def point to the same structure, the pixel field will
    # be set correctly but the color values are undefined. `alloc_named_color` returns
    # nonzero status if a cell is allocated; otherwise, it returns zero.
    #
    # `alloc_named_color` can generate a **BadColor** error.

    # Releases some queued events if the client has caused a device to freeze.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **event_mode** Specifies the event mode. You can pass **AsyncPointer**,
    # **SyncPointer**, **AsyncKeyboard**, **SyncKeyboard**, **ReplayPointer**,
    # **ReplayKeyboard**, **AsyncBoth**, or **SyncBoth**.
    # - **time** Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp or **CurrentTime**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `allow_events` function releases some queued events if the client has caused a device to freeze.
    # It has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the last-grab time of the
    # most recent active grab for the client or if the specified time is later
    # than the current X server time. Depending on the event_mode argument, the following occurs:
    # - **AsyncPointer** If the pointer is frozen by the client, pointer event
    # processing continues as usual. If the pointer is frozen twice by the client
    # on behalf of two separate grabs, **AsyncPointer** thaws for both.
    # **AsyncPointer** has no effect if the pointer is not frozen by the client,
    # but the pointer need not be grabbed by the client.
    # - **SyncPointer** If the pointer is frozen and actively grabbed by the client,
    # pointer event processing continues as usual until the next **ButtonPress**
    # or **ButtonRelease** event is reported to the client. At this time, the
    # pointer again appears to freeze. However, if the reported event causes the
    # pointer grab to be released, the pointer does not freeze. **SyncPointer**
    # has no effect if the pointer is not frozen by the client or if the pointer is not grabbed by the client.
    # - **ReplayPointer** If the pointer is actively grabbed by the client and
    # is frozen as the result of an event having been sent to the client
    # (either from the activation of a `grab_button` or from a previous
    # `allow_events` with mode **SyncPointer** but not from a `grab_pointer`),
    # the pointer grab is released and that event is completely reprocessed.
    # This time, however, the function ignores any passive grabs at or above
    # (towards the root of) the grab_window of the grab just released. The request
    # has no effect if the pointer is not grabbed by the client or if the pointer
    # is not frozen as the result of an event.
    # - **AsyncKeyboard** If the keyboard is frozen by the client, keyboard event
    # processing continues as usual. If the keyboard is frozen twice by the
    # client on behalf of two separate grabs, **AsyncKeyboard** thaws for both.
    # **AsyncKeyboard** has no effect if the keyboard is not frozen by the client,
    # but the keyboard need not be grabbed by the client.
    # - **SyncKeyboard** If the keyboard is frozen and actively grabbed by the client,
    # keyboard event processing continues as usual until the next **KeyPress** or
    # **KeyRelease** event is reported to the client. At this time, the keyboard
    # again appears to freeze. However, if the reported event causes the keyboard
    # grab to be released, the keyboard does not freeze. **SyncKeyboard** has no
    # effect if the keyboard is not frozen by the client or if the keyboard is not grabbed by the client.
    # - **ReplayKeyboard** If the keyboard is actively grabbed by the client and
    # is frozen as the result of an event having been sent to the client
    # (either from the activation of a `grab_key` or from a previous `allow_events`
    # with mode **SyncKeyboard** but not from a `grab_keyboard`), the keyboard
    # grab is released and that event is completely reprocessed. This time,
    # however, the function ignores any passive grabs at or above (towards the root of)
    # the grab_window of the grab just released. The request has no effect if the
    # keyboard is not grabbed by the client or if the keyboard is not frozen as the result of an event.
    # - **SyncBoth** If both pointer and keyboard are frozen by the client,
    # event processing for both devices continues as usual until the next
    # **ButtonPress**, **ButtonRelease**, **KeyPress**, or **KeyRelease** event
    # is reported to the client for a grabbed device (button event for the pointer,
    # key event for the keyboard), at which time the devices again appear to freeze.
    # However, if the reported event causes the grab to be released, then the
    # devices do not freeze (but if the other device is still grabbed, then a
    # subsequent event for it will still cause both devices to freeze).
    # **SyncBoth** has no effect unless both pointer and keyboard are frozen by
    # the client. If the pointer or keyboard is frozen twice by the client on
    # behalf of two separate grabs, **SyncBoth** thaws for both (but a subsequent
    # freeze for **SyncBoth** will only freeze each device once).
    # - **AsyncBoth** If the pointer and the keyboard are frozen by the client,
    # event processing for both devices continues as usual. If a device is frozen
    # twice by the client on behalf of two separate grabs, **AsyncBoth** thaws
    # for both. **AsyncBoth** has no effect unless both pointer and keyboard are frozen by the client.
    # - **AsyncPointer**, **SyncPointer**, and **ReplayPointer** have no effect
    # on the processing of keyboard events. **AsyncKeyboard**, **SyncKeyboard**,
    # and **ReplayKeyboard** have no effect on the processing of pointer events.
    # It is possible for both a pointer grab and a keyboard grab (by the same or
    # different clients) to be active simultaneously. If a device is frozen on
    # behalf of either grab, no event processing is performed for the device.
    # It is possible for a single device to be frozen because of both grabs.
    # In this case, the freeze must be released on behalf of both grabs before
    # events can again be processed. If a device is frozen twice by a single client,
    # then a single **AllowEvents** releases both.
    #

    # ###Description
    # The `bell` function rings the bell on the keyboard, if possible.
    # The specified volume is relative to the base volume for the keyboard.
    # If the value for the percent argument is not in the range -100 to 100 inclusive,
    # a **BadValue** error results. The volume at which the bell rings when the percent argument is nonnegative is:
    # ```
    # base - [(base * percent) / 100] + percent
    # ```
    # The volume at which the bell rings when the percent argument is negative is:
    # ```
    # base + [(base * percent) / 100]
    # ```
    # To change the base volume of the bell, use `change_keyboard_control`.
    #
    # `bell` can generate a **BadValue** error.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values

    # Changes the specified dynamic parameters if the pointer is actively grabbed by the client.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **event_mask** Specifies which pointer events are reported to the client.
    # The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid pointer event mask bits.
    # - **cursor** Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed or **None**.
    # - **time** Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp or **CurrentTime**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `change_active_pointer_grab` function changes the specified dynamic
    # parameters if the pointer is actively grabbed by the client and if the specified
    # time is no earlier than the last-pointer-grab time and no later than the

    # ###Arguments
    # - **gc** Specifies the GC.
    # - **valuemask** Specifies which components in the GC are to be changed
    # using information in the specified values structure. This argument is

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `change_gc` function changes the components specified by valuemask for
    # the specified GC. The values argument contains the values to be set. The
    # values and restrictions are the same as for `create_gc`. Changing the
    # clip-mask overrides any previous `set_clip_rectangles` request on the context.
    # Changing the dash-offset or dash-list overrides any previous `set_dashes`
    # request on the context. The order in which components are verified and
    # altered is server-dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of the components may have been altered.
    # `change_gc` can generate **BadAlloc**, **BadFont**, **BadGC**, **BadMatch**,

    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAlloc** The server failed to allocate the requested source or server memory.
    # - **BadFont** A value for a font argument does not name a defined font (or, in some cases, GContext).
    # - **BadGC** A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and

    # - **keysyms_per_keycode** Specifies the number of KeySyms per KeyCode.
    # - **keysyms** Specifies an array of KeySyms.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `change_keyboard_mapping` function defines the symbols for the
    # specified number of KeyCodes starting with first_keycode. The symbols for
    # KeyCodes outside this range remain unchanged. The number of elements in keysyms must be:
    # ```
    # kysyms.size * keysyms_per_keycode
    # ```
    # The specified first_keycode must be greater than or equal to min_keycode
    # returned by `display_keycodes`, or a **BadValue** error results.
    # In addition, the following expression must be less than or equal to
    # max_keycode as returned by `display_keycodes`, or a **BadValue** error results:
    # ```
    # first_keycode + keysyms.size - 1

    # ```
    # The specified keysyms_per_keycode can be chosen arbitrarily by the client
    # to be large enough to hold all desired symbols. A special KeySym value
    # of **NoSymbol** should be used to fill in unused elements for individual
    # KeyCodes. It is legal for **NoSymbol** to appear in nontrailing positions
    # of the effective list for a KeyCode. `change_keyboard_mapping` generates a **MappingNotify** event.

    # Defines how the pointing device moves.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **do_accel** Specifies a Boolean value that controls whether the values for the accel_numerator or accel_denominator are used.
    # - **do_threshold** Specifies a Boolean value that controls whether the value for the threshold is used.
    # - **accel_numerator** Specifies the numerator for the acceleration multiplier.
    # - **accel_denominator** Specifies the denominator for the acceleration multiplier.
    # - **threshold** Specifies the acceleration threshold.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `change_pointer_control` function defines how the pointing device moves.
    # The acceleration, expressed as a fraction, is a multiplier for movement.
    # For example, specifying 3/1 means the pointer moves three times as fast as normal.
    # The fraction may be rounded arbitrarily by the X server. Acceleration only
    # takes effect if the pointer moves more than threshold pixels at once and only
    # applies to the amount beyond the value in the threshold argument. Setting
    # a value to \-1 restores the default. The values of the do_accel and do_threshold
    # arguments must be True for the pointer values to be set, or the parameters are unchanged.
    # Negative values (other than \-1) generate a BadValue error, as does a zero value for the accel_denominator argument.

    # Alters the property for the specified window.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **w** Specifies the window whose property you want to change.
    # - **property** Specifies the property name.
    # - **type** Specifies the type of the property. The X server does not
    # interpret the type but simply passes it back to an application that later calls `window_property`.
    # - **mode** Specifies the mode of the operation.
    # You can pass **PropModeReplace**, **PropModePrepend**, or **PropModeAppend**.
    # - **data** Specifies the property data.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `change_property` function alters the property for the specified window
    # and causes the X server to generate a **PropertyNotify** event on that window.
    # `change_property` performs the following:
    # - If mode is **PropModeReplace**, `change_property` discards the previous property value and stores the new data.
    # - If mode is **PropModePrepend** or **PropModeAppend**, `change_property`
    # inserts the specified data before the beginning of the existing data or
    # onto the end of the existing data, respectively. The type and format must
    # match the existing property value, or a **BadMatch** error results.
    #
    # The lifetime of a property is not tied to the storing client.

    # depending on the amount of memory the server has available.
    # (If there is insufficient space, a **BadAlloc** error results.)
    #
    # `change_property` can generate **BadAlloc**, **BadAtom**, **BadMatch**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.

    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAlloc** The server failed to allocate the requested source or server memory.
    # - **BadAtom** A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a Drawable.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type
    # and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
    # - **BadPixmap** A value for a Pixmap argument does not name a defined Pixmap.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
    # by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument,
    # the full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
    # - **BadWindow** A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.

    # ###Arguments
    # - **w** Specifies the window that you want to add to or delete from the client's save-set.
    # - **change_mode** Specifies the mode. You can pass **SetModeInsert** or **SetModeDelete**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # Depending on the specified mode, `change_save_set` either inserts or deletes
    # the specified window from the client's save-set. The specified window must
    # have been created by some other client, or a **BadMatch** error results.
    #
    # `change_save_set` can generate **BadMatch**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.

    # Changes the specified window attributes
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **w** Specifies the window.
    # - **valuemask** Specifies which window attributes are defined in the
    # attributes argument. This mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid
    # attribute mask bits. If valuemask is zero, the attributes are ignored and
    # are not referenced. The values and restrictions are the same as for `create_window`.
    # - **attributes** Specifies the structure from which the values
    # (as specified by the value mask) are to be taken. The value mask should
    # have the appropriate bits set to indicate which attributes have been set in the structure (see "Window Attributes").
    #
    # ###Description
    # Depending on the valuemask, the `change_window_attributes` function uses
    # the window attributes in the `set_window_attributes` structure to change
    # the specified window attributes. Changing the background does not cause
    # the window contents to be changed. To repaint the window and its background,
    # use `clear_window`. Setting the border or changing the background such that
    # the border tile origin changes causes the border to be repainted. Changing
    # the background of a root window to **None** or **ParentRelative** restores
    # the default background pixmap. Changing the border of a root window to
    # **CopyFromParent** restores the default border pixmap. Changing the
    # win-gravity does not affect the current position of the window. Changing
    # the backing-store of an obscured window to **WhenMapped** or **Always**, or
    # changing the backing-planes, backing-pixel, or save-under of a mapped window
    # may have no immediate effect. Changing the colormap of a window (that is,
    # defining a new map, not changing the contents of the existing map) generates
    # a **ColormapNotify** event. Changing the colormap of a visible window may
    # have no immediate effect on the screen because the map may not be installed
    # (see `install_colormap`). Changing the cursor of a root window to **None**
    # restores the default cursor. Whenever possible, you are encouraged to share colormaps.
    #
    # Multiple clients can select input on the same window. Their event masks are maintained separately.
    # When an event is generated, it is reported to all interested clients.
    # However, only one client at a time can select for **SubstructureRedirectMask**,
    # **ResizeRedirectMask** and **ButtonPressMask**. If a client attempts to
    # select any of these event masks and some other client has already selected one,
    # a **BadAccess** error results. There is only one do-not-propagate-mask for a window, not one per client.
    #
    # `change_window_attributes` can generate **BadAccess**, **BadColor**,
    # **BadCursor**, **BadMatch**, **BadPixmap**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAccess** A client attempted to free a color map entry that it did not already allocate.
    # - **BadAccess** A client attempted to store into a read-only color map entry.
    # - **BadColor** A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Colormap.
    # - **BadCursor** A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a Drawable.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
    # range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
    # - **BadPixmap** A value for a Pixmap argument does not name a defined Pixmap.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
    # Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
    # by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    # - **width**, **height** Specify the width and height, which are the dimensions of the rectangle.
    # - **exposures** Specifies a Boolean value that indicates if **Expose** events are to be generated.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `clear_area` function paints a rectangular area in the specified
    # window according to the specified dimensions with the window's background
    # pixel or pixmap. The subwindow-mode effectively is **ClipByChildren**.
    # If width is zero, it is replaced with the current width of the window minus x.
    # If height is zero, it is replaced with the current height of the window minus y.
    # If the window has a defined background tile, the rectangle clipped by any children
    # is filled with this tile. If the window has background **None**,
    # the contents of the window are not changed. In either case, if exposures
    # is True, one or more **Expose** events are generated for regions of the

    # Combines the specified rectangle of src with the specified rectangle of dest.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **src**, **dest** Specify the source and destination rectangles to be combined.
    # - **gc** Specifies the GC.
    # - **src_x**, **src_y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
    # to the origin of the source rectangle and specify its upper-left corner.
    # - **width**, **height** Specify the width and height, which are the dimensions
    # of both the source and destination rectangles.
    # - **dest_x**, **dest_y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
    # to the origin of the destination rectangle and specify its upper-left corner
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `copy_area` function combines the specified rectangle of src with the
    # specified rectangle of dest. The drawables must have the same root and depth, or a **BadMatch** error results.
    #
    # If regions of the source rectangle are obscured and have not been retained
    # in backing store or if regions outside the boundaries of the source drawable
    # are specified, those regions are not copied. Instead, the following occurs
    # on all corresponding destination regions that are either visible or are retained
    # in backing store. If the destination is a window with a background other
    # than **None**, corresponding regions of the destination are tiled with that
    # background. Regardless of tiling or whether the destination is a window or a pixmap,
    # if graphics-exposures is **true**, then `GraphicsExpose` events for all
    # corresponding destination regions are generated. If graphics-exposures is
    # **true** but no `GraphicsExpose` events are generated, a **NoExpose** event
    # is generated. Note that by default graphics-exposures is **true** in new GCs.
    #
    # This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, subwindow-mode,
    # graphics-exposure, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.
    #
    # `copy_area` can generate **BadDrawable**, **BadGC**, and **BadMatch** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadDrawable** A value for a *Drawable* argument does not name a defined *Window* or *Pixmap*.
    # - **BadGC** A value for a `GContext` argument does not name a defined `GContext`.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*.

    # the destination GC. This argument is the bitwise inclusive OR of zero or more of the valid GC component mask bits.
    # - **dest** Specifies the destination GC.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `copy_gc` function copies the specified components from the source GC
    # to the destination GC. The source and destination GCs must have the same
    # root and depth, or a **BadMatch** error results. The valuemask
    # specifies which component to copy, as for `create_gc`.
    #
    # `copy_gc` can generate **BadAlloc**, **BadGC**, and **BadMatch** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAlloc** The server failed to allocate the requested source or server memory.
    # - **BadGC** A value for a `GContext` argument does not name a defined `GContext`.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*.

    # Uses a single bit plane of the specified source rectangle combined with the specified GC to modify the specified rectangle of dest.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **src**, **dest** Specify the source and destination rectangles to be combined.
    # - **gc** Specifies the GC.
    # - **src_x**, **src_y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
    # to the origin of the source rectangle and specify its upper-left corner.
    # - **width**, **height** Specify the width and height, which are the dimensions
    # of both the source and destination rectangles.
    # - **dest_x**, **dest_y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
    # to the origin of the destination rectangle and specify its upper-left corner.
    # - **plane** Specifies the bit plane. You must set exactly one bit to 1.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `copy_plane` function uses a single bit plane of the specified source
    # rectangle combined with the specified GC to modify the specified rectangle of dest.
    # The drawables must have the same root but need not have the same depth.
    # If the drawables do not have the same root, a BadMatch error results.
    # If plane does not have exactly one bit set to 1 and the value of plane is
    # not less than 2<sup>**n**</sup>, where **n** is the depth of src, a **BadValue** error results.
    #
    # Effectively, `copy_plane` forms a pixmap of the same depth as the rectangle
    # of dest and with a size specified by the source region. It uses the
    # foreground/background pixels in the GC (foreground everywhere the bit plane
    # in src contains a bit set to 1, background everywhere the bit plane in src
    # contains a bit set to 0) and the equivalent of a **CopyArea** protocol request
    # is performed with all the same exposure semantics. This can also be thought
    # of as using the specified region of the source bit plane as a stipple with a
    # fill-style of **FillOpaqueStippled** for filling a rectangular area of the destination.
    #
    # This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, foreground,
    # background, subwindow-mode, graphics-exposures, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.
    #
    # `copy_plane` can generate **BadDrawable**, **BadGC**, **BadMatch**, and **BadValue** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadDrawable** A value for a *Drawable* argument does not name a defined *Window* or *Pixmap*.
    # - **BadGC** A value for a `GContext` argument does not name a defined `GContext`.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
    # range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
    # by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
    # full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined
    # as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    # ###Description
    # The `destroy_window` function destroys the specified window as well as all

    # ordering of the `DestroyNotify` events is such that for any given window
    # being destroyed, `DestroyNotify` is generated on any inferiors of the window
    # before being generated on the window itself. The ordering among siblings
    # and across subhierarchies is not otherwise constrained. If the window you
    # specified is a root window, no windows are destroyed. Destroying a mapped
    # window will generate `Expose` events on other windows that were obscured by the window being destroyed.

    # ###Description
    # The `destroy_subwindows` function destroys all inferior windows of the
    # specified window, in bottom-to-top stacking order. It causes the X server
    # to generate a `DestroyNotify` event for each window. If any mapped subwindows
    # were actually destroyed, `destroy_subwindows` causes the X server to generate

    # Draws a single circular or elliptical arc.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **d** Specifies the drawable.
    # - **gc** Specifies the GC.
    # - **x**, **y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the
    # origin of the drawable and specify the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle.
    # - **width**, **height** Specify the width and height, which are the major and minor axes of the arc.
    # - **angle1** Specifies the start of the arc relative to the three-o'clock position from the center, in units of degrees * 64.
    # - **angle2** Specifies the path and extent of the arc relative to the start of the arc, in units of degrees * 64.
    #
    # ###Description
    # `draw_arc` draws a single circular or elliptical arc. The arc is specified
    # by a rectangle and two angles. The center of the circle or ellipse is the
    # center of the rectangle, and the major and minor axes are specified by the
    # width and height. Positive angles indicate counterclockwise motion, and negative
    # angles indicate clockwise motion. If the magnitude of angle2 is greater
    # than 360 degrees, `draw_arc` truncates it to 360 degrees.
    #
    # For an arc specified as *[ x, y, width, height, angle1, angle2 ]*, the origin
    # of the major and minor axes is at *[ x + width / 2 , y + height / 2 ]*,
    # and the infinitely thin path describing the entire circle or ellipse intersects
    # the horizontal axis at *[ x, y + height / 2 ]* and *[ x + width , y + height / 2 ]*
    # and intersects the vertical axis at *[ x + width / 2, y ]* and *[ x + width / 2, y + height ]*.
    # These coordinates can be fractional and so are not truncated to discrete coordinates.
    # The path should be defined by the ideal mathematical path. For a wide line
    # with line-width lw, the bounding outlines for filling are given by the two
    # infinitely thin paths consisting of all points whose perpendicular distance
    # from the path of the circle/ellipse is equal to lw/2 (which may be a fractional value).
    # The cap-style and join-style are applied the same as for a line corresponding to the tangent of the circle/ellipse at the endpoint.
    #
    # For an arc specified as *[ x, y, width, height, angle1, angle2 ]*, the
    # angles must be specified in the effectively skewed coordinate system of the
    # ellipse (for a circle, the angles and coordinate systems are identical).
    # The relationship between these angles and angles expressed in the normal
    # coordinate system of the screen (as measured with a protractor) is as follows:
    # ```
    # skewed-angle = atan ( tan ( normal-angle ) * width / height ) + adjust
    # ```
    # The skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in radians (rather than
    # in degrees scaled by 64) in the range *[ 0, 2 pi ]* and where atan returns
    # a value in the range *[ -pi / 2 , pi / 2 ]* and adjust is:
    # -  0 for normal-angle in the range *[ 0, pi / 2 ]*
    # - pi for normal-angle in the range *[ pi / 2 , 3 pi / 2 ]*
    # - 2 pi for normal-angle in the range *[ 3 pi / 2 , 2 pi ]*
    # For any given arc, `draw_arc` does not draw a pixel more than once. If
    # two arcs join correctly and if the line-width is greater than zero and the
    # arcs intersect, `draw_arc` does not draw a pixel more than once. Otherwise,
    # the intersecting pixels of intersecting arcs are drawn multiple times.
    # Specifying an arc with one endpoint and a clockwise extent draws the same
    # pixels as specifying the other endpoint and an equivalent counterclockwise extent, except as it affects joins.
    #
    # If the last point in one arc coincides with the first point in the following arc,
    # the two arcs will join correctly. If the first point in the first arc coincides
    # with the last point in the last arc, the two arcs will join correctly. By specifying
    # one axis to be zero, a horizontal or vertical line can be drawn. Angles are computed
    # based solely on the coordinate system and ignore the aspect ratio.
    #
    # This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, line-width,
    # line-style, cap-style, join-style, fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin,
    # clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. It also uses these GC mode-dependent components:
    # foreground, background, tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, tile-stipple-y-origin, dash-offset, and dash-list.
    #
    # `draw_arc` can generate **BadDrawable**, **BadGC**, and **BadMatch** errors.

    # For any given arc, `draw_arcs` does not draw a pixel more than once.
    # If two arcs join correctly and if the line-width is greater than zero and
    # the arcs intersect, `draw_arc` does not draw a pixel more than once.
    # Otherwise, the intersecting pixels of intersecting arcs are drawn multiple
    # times. Specifying an arc with one endpoint and a clockwise extent draws the
    # same pixels as specifying the other endpoint and an equivalent
    # counterclockwise extent, except as it affects joins.
    #
    # If the last point in one arc coincides with the first point in the
    # following arc, the two arcs will join correctly. If the first point in the
    # first arc coincides with the last point in the last arc, the two arcs will
    # join correctly. By specifying one axis to be zero, a horizontal or vertical
    # line can be drawn. Angles are computed based solely on
    # the coordinate system and ignore the aspect ratio.

    # ###Arguments
    # - **d** Specifies the drawable.
    # - **gc** Specifies the GC.
    # - **x**, **y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the
    # origin of the specified drawable and define the origin of the first character.
    # - **items** Specifies an array of text items.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `draw_text` function allows complex spacing and font shifts between counted strings.
    #
    # Each text item is processed in turn. A font member other than **None** in
    # an item causes the font to be stored in the GC and used for subsequent text.
    # A text element delta specifies an additional change in the position along
    # the x axis before the string is drawn. The delta is always added to the
    # character origin and is not dependent on any characteristics of the font.
    # Each character image, as defined by the font in the GC, is treated as an
    # additional mask for a fill operation on the drawable. The drawable is modified
    # only where the font character has a bit set to 1. If a text item generates
    # a **BadFont** error, the previous text items may have been drawn.
    #
    # For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than 2-byte matrix indexing,
    # each `X11::C::X::Char2b` structure is interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most-significant byte.
    #
    # The function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
    # font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. It also
    # uses these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background, tile, stipple,
    # tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

    #
    # ###Description
    # If mode is **QueuedAlready**, `events_queued` returns the number of events
    # already in the event queue (and never performs a system call). If mode is
    # **QueuedAfterFlush**, `events_queued` returns the number of events already

    # `events_queued` flushes the output buffer, attempts to read more events out
    # of the application's connection, and returns the number read. If mode is
    # **QueuedAfterReading**, `events_queued` returns the number of events already
    # in the queue if the number is nonzero. If there are no events in the queue,
    # `events_queued` attempts to read more events out of the application's connection
    # without flushing the output buffer and returns the number read.

    # You can pass **CoordModeOrigin** or **CoordModePrevious**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # `fill_polygon` fills the region closed by the specified path. The path is
    # closed automatically if the last point in the list does not coincide with
    # the first point. `fill_polygon` does not draw a pixel of the region more
    # than once. **CoordModeOrigin** treats all coordinates as relative to the
    # origin, and **CoordModePrevious** treats all coordinates after the first
    # as relative to the previous point.
    #
    # Depending on the specified shape, the following occurs:
    # - If shape is **Complex**, the path may self-intersect. Note that contiguous
    # coincident points in the path are not treated as self-intersection.
    # - If shape is **Convex**, for every pair of points inside the polygon, the
    # line segment connecting them does not intersect the path. If known by the
    # client, specifying **Convex** can improve performance. If you specify
    # **Convex** for a path that is not convex, the graphics results are undefined.
    # - If shape is **Nonconvex**, the path does not self-intersect, but the
    # shape is not wholly convex. If known by the client, specifying **Nonconvex**
    # instead of **Complex** may improve performance. If you specify **Nonconvex**
    # for a self-intersecting path, the graphics results are undefined.
    #
    # The fill-rule of the GC controls the filling behavior of self-intersecting polygons.
    #
    # This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
    # fill-rule, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.
    # It also uses these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background,

    # The `free_colormap` function deletes the association between the colormap
    # resource ID and the colormap and frees the colormap storage. However, this
    # function has no effect on the default colormap for a screen. If the
    # specified colormap is an installed map for a screen, it is uninstalled
    # (see `uninstall_colormap`). If the specified colormap is defined as the
    # colormap for a window (by `create_window`, `set_window_colormap`, or
    # `change_window_attributes`), `free_colormap` changes the colormap associated
    # with the window to **None** and generates a **ColormapNotify** event.
    # X does not define the colors displayed for a window with a colormap of **None**.
    #
    # `free_colormap` can generate a **BadColor** error.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadColor** A value for a *Colormap* argument does not name a defined *Colormap*.
    #
    # ###See also
    # `alloc_color`, `change_window_attributes`, `copy_colormap_and_free`,
    # `create_colormap`, `create_window`, `query_color`, `store_colors`.

    # Frees the cells represented by pixels.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **colormap** Specifies the colormap.
    # - **pixels** Specifies an array of pixel values that map to the cells in the specified colormap.
    # - **planes** Specifies the planes you want to free.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `free_colors` function frees the cells represented by pixels whose
    # values are in the pixels array. The planes argument should not have any
    # bits set to 1 in common with any of the pixels. The set of all pixels is
    # produced by **ORing** together subsets of the planes argument with the pixels.
    # The request frees all of these pixels that were allocated by the client
    # (using `alloc_color`, `alloc_named_color`, `alloc_color_cells`, and `alloc_color_planes`).
    # Note that freeing an individual pixel obtained from `alloc_color_planes`
    # may not actually allow it to be reused until all of its related pixels are
    # also freed. Similarly, a read-only entry is not actually freed until it has
    # been freed by all clients, and if a client allocates the same read-only entry
    # multiple times, it must free the entry that many times before the entry is actually freed.
    #
    # All specified pixels that are allocated by the client in the colormap are freed,
    # even if one or more pixels produce an error. If a specified pixel is not a
    # valid index into the colormap, a **BadValue** error results. If a specified
    # pixel is not allocated by the client (that is, is unallocated or is only allocated
    # by another client) or if the colormap was created with all entries writable
    # (by passing **AllocAll** to `create_colormap`), a **BadAccess** error results.
    # If more than one pixel is in error, the one that gets reported is arbitrary.
    #
    # `free_colors` can generate **BadAccess**, **BadColor**, and **BadValue** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAccess** A client attempted to free a color map entry that it did not already allocate.
    # - **BadAccess** A client attempted to store into a read-only color map entry.
    # - **BadColor** A value for a *Colormap* argument does not name a defined *Colormap*.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
    # by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full
    # range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as
    # a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    # Determines the placement of a window using a geometry specification.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **screen** Specifies the screen.
    # - **position**, **default_position** Specify the geometry specifications.
    # - **bwidth** Specifies the border width.
    # - **fheight**, **fwidth** Specify the font height and width in pixels (increment size).
    # - **xadder**, **yadder** Specify additional interior padding needed in the window.
    #
    # ###Return
    # - **x**, **y** Return the x and y offsets.
    # - **width**, **height** Return the width and height determined.
    #
    # ###Description
    # You pass in the border width (bwidth), size of the increments fwidth and
    # fheight (typically font width and height), and any additional interior space
    # (xadder and yadder) to make it easy to compute the resulting size.
    # The `geometry` function returns the position the window should be placed given
    # a position and a default position. `geometry` determines the placement of a
    # window using a geometry specification as specified by `parse_geometry` and
    # the additional information about the window. Given a fully qualified default
    # geometry specification and an incomplete geometry specification,
    # `parse_geometry` returns a bitmask value as defined above in the
    # `parse_geometry` call, by using the position argument.
    #
    # The returned width and height will be the width and height specified by
    # default_position as overridden by any user-specified position. They are not
    # affected by fwidth, fheight, xadder, or yadder. The x and y coordinates are
    # computed by using the border width, the screen width and height, padding as
    # specified by xadder and yadder, and the fheight and fwidth times the width
    # and height from the geometry specifications.

    # Returns a message from the error message database.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **name** Specifies the name of the application.
    # - **message** Specifies the type of the error message.
    # - **default_string** Specifies the default error message if none is found in the database.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `error_database_text` function returns a message (or the default message)
    # from the error message database. Xlib uses this function internally to look
    # up its error messages. The text in the default_string argument is assumed
    # to be in the encoding of the current locale, and the text stored in the
    # buffer_return argument is in the encoding of the current locale.
    #
    # The name argument should generally be the name of your application. The
    # message argument should indicate which type of error message you want.
    # If the name and message are not in the Host Portable Character Encoding,
    # the result is implementation dependent. Xlib uses three predefined
    #  +application names+ to report errors. In these names, uppercase and
    # lowercase matter.
    #
    # - **XProtoError** The protocol error number is used as a string for the message argument.
    # - **XlibMessage** These are the message strings that are used internally by the library.
    # - **XRequest** For a core protocol request, the major request protocol number
    # is used for the message argument. For an extension request, the extension name
    # (as given by `init_extension`) followed by a period (.) and the minor request
    # protocol number is used for the message argument. If no string is found in
    # the error database, the default_string is returned to the buffer argument.

    # This argument is the bitwise inclusive OR of zero or more of the valid GC component mask bits.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `gc_values` function returns the components specified by valuemask for
    # the specified GC. If the valuemask contains a valid set of GC mask bits
    # (**GCFunction**, **GCPlaneMask**, **GCForeground**, **GCBackground**,

    # or **GCArcMode**) and no error occurs, `gc_values` sets the requested components
    # in values_return and returns a nonzero status. Otherwise, it returns a
    # zero status. Note that the clip-mask and dash-list (represented by the
    # **GCClipMask** and **GCDashList** bits, respectively, in the valuemask)
    # cannot be requested. Also note that an invalid resource ID (with one or
    # more of the three most-significant bits set to 1) will be returned for
    # **GCFont**, **GCTile**, and **GCStipple** if the component has never been explicitly set by the client.

    # - **bytes_after** Returns the number of bytes remaining to be read in the property if a partial read was performed.
    # - **prop** Returns the data in the specified format.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `window_property` function returns the actual type of the property;
    # the actual format of the property; the number of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit
    # items transferred; the number of bytes remaining to be read in the property;
    # and a string of the data actually returned. `window_property` sets the return arguments as follows:
    # - If the specified property does not exist for the specified window,
    # `window_property` returns **None** to actual_type_return and the value zero
    # to actual_format_return and bytes_after_return. The nitems_return argument
    # is empty. In this case, the delete argument is ignored.
    # - If the specified property exists but its type does not match the
    # specified type, `window_property` returns the actual property type to
    # actual_type_return, the actual property format (never zero) to actual_format_return,
    # and the property length in bytes (even if the actual_format_return is 16 or 32)
    # to bytes_after_return. It also ignores the delete argument. The nitems_return argument is empty.
    # - If the specified property exists and either you assign **AnyPropertyType**
    # to the req_type argument or the specified type matches the actual property type,
    # `window_property` returns the actual property type to actual_type_return and
    # the actual property format (never zero) to actual_format_return. It also returns
    # a value to bytes_after_return and nitems_return, by defining the following values:
    # ```
    # N = actual length of the stored property in bytes (even if the format is 16 or 32)
    # I = 4 * long_offset
    # T = N - I
    # L = MINIMUM(T, 4 * long_length)
    # A = N - (I + L)
    # ```
    #The returned value starts at byte index I in the property (indexing from zero),
    # and its length in bytes is L. If the value for long_offset causes L to be negative,
    # a **BadValue** error results. The value of bytes_after_return is A, giving
    # the number of trailing unread bytes in the stored property.
    #
    # If the returned format is 8, the returned data is represented as a char array.
    # If the returned format is 16, the returned data is represented as a short array
    # and should be cast to that type to obtain the elements. If the returned format
    # is 32, the returned data is represented as a long array and should be cast
    # to that type to obtain the elements.
    #
    # If delete is **true** and bytes_after is zero, `window_property` deletes the
    # property from the window and generates a **PropertyNotify** event on the window.
    #
    # The function returns **Success** in res if it executes successfully.
    #
    # `window_property` can generate **BadAtom**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAtom** A value for an *Atom* argument does not name a defined *Atom*.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
    # by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
    # full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined
    # as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
    # - **BadWindow** A value for a *Window* argument does not name a defined *Window*.

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `window_attributes` function returns the current attributes for the
    # specified window to an `WindowAttributes` structure.
    #

    # - **CenterGravity**
    #
    # The **backing_store** member is set to indicate how the X server should maintain
    # the contents of a window and can be **WhenMapped**, **Always**, or **NotUseful**.
    #
    # The **backing_planes** member is set to indicate (with bits set to 1) which
    # bit planes of the window hold dynamic data that must be preserved in backing_stores and during save_unders.
    #
    # The **backing_pixel** member is set to indicate what values to use for planes not set in backing_planes.
    #

    #
    # The **override_redirect** member is set to indicate whether this window
    # overrides structure control facilities and can be **true** or **false**.
    # Window manager clients should ignore the window if this member is **true**.
    #
    # The **screen** member is set to a screen pointer that gives you a back
    # pointer to the correct screen. This makes it easier to obtain the screen
    # information without having to loop over the root window fields to see which field matches.
    #
    # `window_attributes` can generate **BadDrawable** and **BadWindow** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadDrawable** A value for a *Drawable* argument does not name a defined *Window* or *Pixmap*.
    # - **BadWindow** A value for a *Window* argument does not name a defined *Window*.

    # Establishes a passive grab.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **button** Specifies the pointer button that is to be grabbed or **AnyButton**.
    # - **modifiers** Specifies the set of keymasks or **AnyModifier**. The mask
    # is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid keymask bits.
    # - **grab_window** Specifies the grab window.
    # - **owner_events** Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the
    # pointer events are to be reported as usual or reported with respect to the
    # grab window if selected by the event mask.
    # - **event_mask** Specifies which pointer events are reported to the client.
    # The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid pointer event mask bits.
    # - **pointer_mode** Specifies further processing of pointer events.
    # You can pass **GrabModeSync** or **GrabModeAsync**.
    # - **keyboard_mode** Specifies further processing of keyboard events.
    # You can pass **GrabModeSync** or **GrabModeAsync**.
    # - **confine_to*** Specifies the window to confine the pointer in or **None**.
    # - **cursor** Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed or **None**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `grab_button` function establishes a passive grab. In the future, the
    # pointer is actively grabbed (as for `grab_pointer`), the last-pointer-grab
    # time is set to the time at which the button was pressed (as transmitted in
    # the **ButtonPress** event), and the **ButtonPress** event is reported if
    # all of the following conditions are true:
    # - The pointer is not grabbed, and the specified button is logically pressed
    # when the specified modifier keys are logically down,
    # and no other buttons or modifier keys are logically down.
    # - The **grab_window** contains the pointer.
    # - The **confine_to** window (if any) is viewable.
    # - A passive grab on the same button/key combination does not exist on any ancestor of grab_window.
    #
    # The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for `grab_pointer`.
    # The active grab is terminated automatically when the logical state of the
    # pointer has all buttons released (independent of the state of the logical modifier keys).
    #
    # Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client applications)
    # may lag the physical state if device event processing is frozen.
    #
    # This request overrides all previous grabs by the same client on the same
    # button/key combinations on the same window. A modifiers of **AnyModifier**
    # is equivalent to issuing the grab request for all possible modifier combinations
    # (including the combination of no modifiers). It is not required that all
    # modifiers specified have currently assigned **KeyCodes**. A button of
    # **AnyButton** is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible buttons.
    # Otherwise, it is not required that the specified button currently be assigned to a physical button.
    #
    # If some other client has already issued a `grab_button` with the same
    # button/key combination on the same window, a **BadAccess** error results.
    # When using **AnyModifier** or **AnyButton**, the request fails completely,
    # and a **BadAccess** error results (no grabs are established) if there is a
    # conflicting grab for any combination. `grab_button` has no effect on an active grab.
    #
    # `grab_button` can generate **BadCursor**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadCursor** A value for a *Cursor* argument does not name a defined *Cursor*.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted

    # ###Description
    # The `grab_key` function establishes a passive grab on the keyboard. In the
    # future, the keyboard is actively grabbed (as for `grab_keyboard`), the
    # last-keyboard-grab time is set to the time at which the key was pressed
    # (as transmitted in the **KeyPress** event), and the **KeyPress** event is
    # reported if all of the following conditions are true:
    # - The keyboard is not grabbed and the specified key (which can itself be
    # a modifier key) is logically pressed when the specified modifier keys are
    # logically down, and no other modifier keys are logically down.
    # - Either the grab_window is an ancestor of (or is) the focus window, or the
    # grab_window is a descendant of the focus window and contains the pointer.
    # - A passive grab on the same key combination does not exist on any ancestor of grab_window.
    #
    # The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for `grab_keyboard`.
    # The active grab is terminated automatically when the logical state of the

    # It is not required that all modifiers specified have currently assigned KeyCodes.
    # A keycode argument of **AnyKey** is equivalent to issuing the request for all
    # possible KeyCodes. Otherwise, the specified keycode must be in the range
    # specified by min_keycode and max_keycode in the connection setup, or a **BadValue** error results.
    #
    # If some other client has issued a `grab_key` with the same key combination

    # or **AnyKey**, the request fails completely, and a **BadAccess** error results
    # (no grabs are established) if there is a conflicting grab for any combination.
    #
    # `grab_key` can generate **BadAccess**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAccess** A client attempted to free a color map entry that it did not already allocate.
    # - **BadAccess** A client attempted to store into a read-only color map entry.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
    # by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `grab_keyboard` function actively grabs control of the keyboard and
    # generates **FocusIn** and **FocusOut** events. Further key events are
    # reported only to the grabbing client. `grab_keyboard` overrides any active
    # keyboard grab by this client. If owner_events is **false**, all generated key
    # events are reported with respect to grab_window. If owner_events is **true**
    # and if a generated key event would normally be reported to this client, it
    # is reported normally; otherwise, the event is reported with respect to the grab_window.
    # Both **KeyPress** and **KeyRelease** events are always reported, independent
    # of any event selection made by the client.
    #
    # If the keyboard_mode argument is **GrabModeAsync**, keyboard event processing
    # continues as usual. If the keyboard is currently frozen by this client, then
    # processing of keyboard events is resumed. If the keyboard_mode argument is
    # **GrabModeSync**, the state of the keyboard (as seen by client applications)
    # appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further keyboard events until
    # the grabbing client issues a releasing `allow_events` call or until the keyboard
    # grab is released. Actual keyboard changes are not lost while the keyboard is
    # frozen; they are simply queued in the server for later processing.
    #
    # If pointer_mode is **GrabModeAsync**, pointer event processing is unaffected
    # by activation of the grab. If pointer_mode is **GrabModeSync**, the state
    # of the pointer (as seen by client applications) appears to freeze, and the
    # X server generates no further pointer events until the grabbing client issues

    #
    # If the keyboard is actively grabbed by some other client, `grab_keyboard`
    # fails and returns **AlreadyGrabbed**. If grab_window is not viewable, it
    # fails and returns **GrabNotViewable**. If the keyboard is frozen by an active
    # grab of another client, it fails and returns **GrabFrozen**. If the specified time
    # is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab time or later than the current X server
    # time, it fails and returns **GrabInvalidTime**. Otherwise, the last-keyboard-grab
    # time is set to the specified time (**CurrentTime** is replaced by the current X server time).

    # ###Description
    # The `grab_pointer` function actively grabs control of the pointer and

    # of owner_events, unreported events are discarded.
    #
    # If the pointer_mode is **GrabModeAsync**, pointer event processing continues
    # as usual. If the pointer is currently frozen by this client, the processing
    # of events for the pointer is resumed. If the pointer_mode is **GrabModeSync**,

    #
    # If a cursor is specified, it is displayed regardless of what window the pointer
    # is in. If **None** is specified, the normal cursor for that window is displayed
    # when the pointer is in grab_window or one of its subwindows; otherwise, the cursor for grab_window is displayed.
    #
    # If a confine_to window is specified, the pointer is restricted to stay contained
    # in that window. The confine_to window need have no relationship to the
    # grab_window. If the pointer is not initially in the confine_to window, it
    # is warped automatically to the closest edge just before the grab activates
    # and enter/leave events are generated as usual. If the confine_to window is
    # subsequently reconfigured, the pointer is warped automatically, as necessary,
    # to keep it contained in the window.
    #
    # The time argument allows you to avoid certain circumstances that come up if
    # applications take a long time to respond or if there are long network delays.
    # Consider a situation where you have two applications, both of which normally
    # grab the pointer when clicked on. If both applications specify the timestamp
    # from the event, the second application may wake up faster and successfully
    # grab the pointer before the first application. The first application then will
    # get an indication that the other application grabbed the pointer before its request was processed.
    #
    # `grab_pointer` generates **EnterNotify** and **LeaveNotify** events.
    #
    # Either if grab_window or confine_to window is not viewable or if the
    # confine_to window lies completely outside the boundaries of the root window,
    # `grab_pointer` fails and returns **GrabNotViewable**. If the pointer is
    # actively grabbed by some other client, it fails and returns **AlreadyGrabbed**.
    # If the pointer is frozen by an active grab of another client, it fails and
    # returns **GrabFrozen**. If the specified time is earlier than the
    # last-pointer-grab time or later than the current X server time, it fails
    # and returns GrabInvalidTime. Otherwise, the last-pointer-grab time is set
    # to the specified time (**CurrentTime** is replaced by the current X server time).
    #
    # `grab_pointer` can generate **BadCursor**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.
    #

    # ###Description
    # The `kill_client` function forces a close-down of the client that created
    # the resource if a valid resource is specified. If the client has already
    # terminated in either **RetainPermanent** or **RetainTemporary** mode, all

    # the resources of all clients that have terminated in **RetainTemporary**
    # are destroyed. This permits implementation of window manager facilities
    # that aid debugging. A client can set its close-down mode to **RetainTemporary**.
    # If the client then crashes, its windows would not be destroyed. The programmer
    #can then inspect the application's window tree and use the window manager to destroy the zombie windows.

    # ###Description
    # The `lower_window` function lowers the specified window to the bottom of
    # the stack so that it does not obscure any sibling windows. If the windows
    # are regarded as overlapping sheets of paper stacked on a desk, then lowering
    # a window is analogous to moving the sheet to the bottom of the stack but
    # leaving its x and y location on the desk constant. Lowering a mapped window
    # will generate **Expose** events on any windows it formerly obscured.
    #
    # If the override-redirect attribute of the window is **false** and some
    # other client has selected **SubstructureRedirectMask** on the parent, the
    # X server generates a **ConfigureRequest** event, and no processing is performed.
    # Otherwise, the window is lowered to the bottom of the stack.

    # The `map_subwindows` function maps all subwindows for a specified window

    # Maps the window and all of its subwindows that have had map requests.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **w** Specifies the window.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `map_window` function maps the window and all of its subwindows that
    # have had map requests. Mapping a window that has an unmapped ancestor does
    # not display the window but marks it as eligible for display when the ancestor
    # becomes mapped. Such a window is called unviewable. When all its ancestors
    # are mapped, the window becomes viewable and will be visible on the screen
    # if it is not obscured by another window. This function has no effect if
    # the window is already mapped.
    #
    # If the override-redirect of the window is **false** and if some other client
    # has selected **SubstructureRedirectMask** on the parent window, then the
    # X server generates a **MapRequest** event, and the `map_window` function
    # does not map the window. Otherwise, the window is mapped,
    # and the X server generates a **MapNotify** event.
    #
    # If the window becomes viewable and no earlier contents for it are remembered,
    # the X server tiles the window with its background. If the window's background
    # is undefined, the existing screen contents are not altered, and the X server
    # generates zero or more **Expose** events. If backing-store was maintained
    # while the window was unmapped, no **Expose** events are generated. If
    # backing-store will now be maintained, a full-window exposure is always
    # generated. Otherwise, only visible regions may be reported. Similar
    # tiling and exposure take place for any newly viewable inferiors.
    #
    # If the window is an **InputOutput** window, `map_window` generates
    # **Expose** events on each **InputOutput** window that it causes to be displayed.
    # If the client maps and paints the window and if the client begins processing
    # events, the window is painted twice. To avoid this, first ask for **Expose**
    # events and then map the window, so the client processes input events as usual.
    # The event list will include Expose for each window that has appeared on the screen.
    # The client's normal response to an Expose event should be to repaint the window.
    # This method usually leads to simpler programs and to proper interaction with window managers.
    #
    # `map_window` can generate a **BadWindow** error.

    # - **width**, **height** Specify the width and height, which define the interior size of the window.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `move_resize_window` function changes the size and location of the
    # specified window without raising it. Moving and resizing a mapped window
    # may generate an **Expose** event on the window. Depending on the new size
    # and location parameters, moving and resizing a window may generate **Expose**
    # events on windows that the window formerly obscured.
    #
    # If the override-redirect flag of the window is **false** and some other

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `move_window` function moves the specified window to the specified x
    # and y coordinates, but it does not change the window's size, raise the window,

    # not lose the window's contents depending on if the window is obscured by
    # nonchildren and if no backing store exists. If the contents of the window

    # Combines an image with a rectangle of the specified drawable.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **d** Specifies the drawable.
    # - **gc** Specifies the GC.
    # - **image** Specifies the image you want combined with the rectangle.
    # - **src_x** Specifies the offset in X from the left edge of the image defined by the `Image` object.
    # - **src_y** Specifies the offset in Y from the top edge of the image defined by the `Image` object.
    # - **dest_x**, **dest_y** Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
    # to the origin of the drawable and are the coordinates of the subimage.
    # - **width**, **height** Specify the width and height of the subimage,
    # which define the dimensions of the rectangle.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `put_image` function combines an image with a rectangle of the specified
    # drawable. The section of the image defined by the src_x, src_y, width, and
    # height arguments is drawn on the specified part of the drawable. If
    # **XYBitmap** format is used, the depth of the image must be one, or a
    # **BadMatch** error results. The foreground pixel in the GC defines the
    # source for the one bits in the image, and the background pixel defines the
    # source for the zero bits. For **XYPixmap** and **ZPixmap**, the depth of
    # the image must match the depth of the drawable, or a **BadMatch** error results.
    #
    # If the characteristics of the image (for example, byte_order and bitmap_unit)
    # differ from what the server requires, `put_image` automatically makes the appropriate conversions.
    #
    # This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, subwindow-mode,
    # clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. It also uses these GC
    # mode-dependent components: foreground and background.
    #
    # `put_image` can generate **BadDrawable**, **BadGC**, **BadMatch**, and **BadValue** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadDrawable** A value for a *Drawable* argument does not name a defined *Window* or *Pixmap*.
    # - **BadGC** A value for a `GContext` argument does not name a defined `GContext`.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
    # range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
    # by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
    # full range defined by the argument's type is accepted.
    # Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    # Raises the specified window to the top of the
    # stack so that no sibling window obscures it.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **w** Specifies the window.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `raise_window` function raises the specified window to the top of the
    # stack so that no sibling window obscures it. If the windows are regarded as
    # overlapping sheets of paper stacked on a desk, then raising a window is
    # analogous to moving the sheet to the top of the stack but leaving its x and
    # y location on the desk constant. Raising a mapped window may generate
    # **Expose** events for the window and any mapped subwindows that were formerly obscured.
    #
    # If the override-redirect attribute of the window is **false** and some other
    # client has selected **SubstructureRedirectMask** on the parent, the X
    # server generates a **ConfigureRequest** event, and no processing is performed.
    # Otherwise, the window is raised.
    #
    # `raise_window` can generate a **BadWindow** error.

    # Reads in a file containing a bitmap.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **d** Specifies the drawable that indicates the screen.
    # - **filename** Specifies the file name to use.
    # The format of the file name is operating-system dependent.
    #
    # ###Returns
    # - **width**, **height** Return the width and height values of the read in bitmap file.
    # - **bitmap** Returns the bitmap that is created.
    # - **x_hot**, **y_hot** Return the hotspot coordinates.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `read_bitmap_file` function reads in a file containing a bitmap.
    # The file is parsed in the encoding of the current locale. The ability to
    # read other than the standard format is implementation dependent. If the
    # file cannot be opened, `read_bitmap_file` returns **BitmapOpenFailed**.
    # If the file can be opened but does not contain valid bitmap data, it
    # returns **BitmapFileInvalid**. If insufficient working storage is allocated,
    # it returns **BitmapNoMemory**. If the file is readable and valid, it returns **BitmapSuccess**.
    #
    # `read_bitmap_file` returns the bitmap's height and width, as read from the
    # file, to width and height. It then creates a pixmap of the appropriate size,
    # reads the bitmap data from the file into the pixmap, and assigns the pixmap
    # to the caller's variable bitmap. The caller must free the bitmap using
    # `free_pixmap` when finished. If name_x_hot and name_y_hot exist,
    # `read_bitmap_file` returns them to x_hot and y_hot; otherwise, it returns -1,-1.
    #
    # `read_bitmap_file` can generate **BadAlloc**, **BadDrawable**, and **BadGC** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadAlloc** The server failed to allocate the requested source or server memory.
    # - **BadDrawable** A value for a *Drawable* argument does not name a defined *Window* or *Pixmap*.
    # - **BadGC** A value for a `GContext` argument does not name a defined `GContext`.

    # - **string** Specifies the string that is copied and will
    # be returned by `KeyEvent::lookup_string`.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `rebind_keysym` function can be used to rebind the meaning of a KeySym
    # for the client. It does not redefine any key in the X server but merely
    # provides an easy way for long strings to be attached to keys.
    # `KexEvent::lookup_string` returns this string when the appropriate set of

    # Places the window in the stacking order on top with respect to sibling windows.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **w** Specifies the window.
    # - **parent** Specifies the parent window.
    # - **x**, **y** Specify the x and y coordinates of the position in the new parent window.
    #
    # ###Description
    # If the specified window is mapped, `reparent_window` automatically performs
    # an **UnmapWindow** request on it, removes it from its current position in
    # the hierarchy, and inserts it as the child of the specified parent. The
    # window is placed in the stacking order on top with respect to sibling windows.
    #
    # After reparenting the specified window, `reparent_window` causes the X server
    # to generate a **ReparentNotify** event. The override_redirect member returned
    # in this event is set to the window's corresponding attribute. Window manager
    # clients usually should ignore this window if this member is set to **true**.
    # Finally, if the specified window was originally mapped, the X server
    # automatically performs a **MapWindow** request on it.
    #
    # The X server performs normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows.
    # The X server might not generate **Expose** events for regions from the initial
    # **UnmapWindow** request that are immediately obscured by the final
    # **MapWindow** request. A **BadMatch** error results if:
    # - The new parent window is not on the same screen as the old parent window.

    # - **w** Specifies the window.
    # - **properties** Specifies the array of properties that are to be rotated.
    # - **npositions** Specifies the rotation amount.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `rotate_window_properties` function allows you to rotate properties on
    # a window and causes the X server to generate **PropertyNotify** events.
    # If the property names in the properties array are viewed as being numbered
    # starting from zero and if there are `properties.size` property names in the list,
    # then the value associated with property name I becomes the value associated with
    # property name (I + npositions) mod N for all I from zero to N - 1.
    # The effect is to rotate the states by npositions places around the virtual
    # ring of property names (right for positive npositions, left for negative npositions).
    # If npositions mod N is nonzero, the X server generates a **PropertyNotify**
    # event for each property in the order that they are listed in the array.
    # If an atom occurs more than once in the list or no property with that name
    # is defined for the window, a **BadMatch** error results. If a **BadAtom**
    # or **BadMatch** error results, no properties are changed.

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `select_input` function requests that the X server report the events
    # associated with the specified event mask. Initially, X will not report any
    # of these events. Events are reported relative to a window. If a window is
    # not interested in a device event, it usually propagates to the closest
    # ancestor that is interested, unless the do_not_propagate mask prohibits it.
    #
    # Setting the event-mask attribute of a window overrides any previous call
    # for the same window but not for other clients. Multiple clients can select
    # for the same events on the same window with the following restrictions:
    # - Multiple clients can select events on the same window because their event
    # masks are disjoint. When the X server generates an event, it reports it to all interested clients.
    # - Only one client at a time can select **CirculateRequest**,
    # **ConfigureRequest**, or **MapRequest** events, which are associated with
    # the event mask **SubstructureRedirectMask**.
    # - Only one client at a time can select a **ResizeRequest** event,
    # which is associated with the event mask **ResizeRedirectMask**.
    # - Only one client at a time can select a **ButtonPress** event, which
    # is associated with the event mask **ButtonPressMask**.
    # The server reports the event to all interested clients.
    #
    # `select_input` can generate a **BadWindow** error.

    # - If w is **PointerWindow**, the destination window is the window that contains the pointer.
    # - If w is **InputFocus** and if the focus window contains the pointer,
    # the destination window is the window that contains the pointer; otherwise,
    # the destination window is the focus window.
    # To determine which clients should receive the specified events,
    # `send_event` uses the propagate argument as follows:
    # - If event_mask is the empty set, the event is sent to the client that
    # created the destination window. If that client no longer exists, no event is sent.
    # - If propagate is **false**, the event is sent to every client selecting
    # on destination any of the event types in the event_mask argument.
    # - If propagate is **true** and no clients have selected on destination any
    # of the event types in event-mask, the destination is replaced with the closest
    # ancestor of destination for which some client has selected a type in event-mask
    # and for which no intervening window has that type in its do-not-propagate-mask.
    # If no such window exists or if the window is an ancestor of the focus window
    # and **InputFocus** was originally specified as the destination, the event
    # is not sent to any clients. Otherwise, the event is reported to every client
    # selecting on the final destination any of the types specified in event_mask.
    #
    # The event in the `Event` object must be one of the core events or one of
    # the events defined by an extension (or a **BadValue** error results) so that
    # the X server can correctly byte-swap the contents as necessary. The contents
    # of the event are otherwise unaltered and unchecked by the X server except to
    # force send_event to **true** in the forwarded event and to set the serial
    # number in the event correctly; therefore these fields and the display
    # field are ignored by `send_event`.
    #
    # `send_event` returns zero if the conversion to wire protocol
    # format failed and returns nonzero otherwise.
    #
    # `send_event` can generate **BadValue** and **BadWindow** errors.

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `set_clip_rectangles` function changes the clip-mask in the specified
    # GC to the specified list of rectangles and sets the clip origin. The output
    # is clipped to remain contained within the rectangles. The clip-origin is
    # interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified
    # in a graphics request. The rectangle coordinates are interpreted relative to
    # the clip-origin. The rectangles should be nonintersecting, or the graphics
    # results will be undefined. Note that the list of rectangles can be empty,
    # which effectively disables output. This is the opposite of passing **None**
    # as the clip-mask in `create_gc`, `change_gc`, and `set_clip_mask`.
    #
    # If known by the client, ordering relations on the rectangles can be specified
    # with the ordering argument. This may provide faster operation by the server.
    # If an incorrect ordering is specified, the X server may generate a **BadMatch**
    # error, but it is not required to do so. If no error is generated, the graphics
    # results are undefined. Unsorted means the rectangles are in arbitrary order.
    # **YSorted** means that the rectangles are nondecreasing in their Y origin.
    # **YXSorted** additionally constrains **YSorted** order in that all rectangles
    # with an equal Y origin are nondecreasing in their X origin. **YXBanded**
    # additionally constrains **YXSorted** by requiring that, for every possible
    # Y scanline, all rectangles that include that scanline have an identical Y origins and Y extents.
    #
    # `set_clip_rectangles` can generate **BadAlloc**, **BadGC**, **BadMatch**,

    # Sets the dash-offset and dash-list attributes for

    # ###Arguments
    # - **gc** Specifies the GC.
    # - **dash_offset** Specifies the phase of the pattern for the dashed line-style you want to set for the specified GC.
    # - **dash_list** Specifies the dash-list for the dashed line-style you want to set for the specified GC.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `set_dashes` function sets the dash-offset and dash-list attributes for
    # dashed line styles in the specified GC. There must be at least one element
    # in the specified dash_list, or a **BadValue** error results. The initial
    # and alternating elements (second, fourth, and so on) of the dash_list are
    # the even dashes, and the others are the odd dashes. Each element specifies
    # a dash length in pixels. All of the elements must be nonzero, or a
    # **BadValue** error results. Specifying an odd-length list is equivalent to
    # specifying the same list concatenated with itself to produce an even-length list.
    #
    # The dash-offset defines the phase of the pattern, specifying how many
    # pixels into the dash-list the pattern should actually begin in any single
    # graphics request. Dashing is continuous through path elements combined with
    # a join-style but is reset to the dash-offset between each sequence of joined lines.
    #
    # The unit of measure for dashes is the same for the ordinary coordinate system.
    # Ideally, a dash length is measured along the slope of the line, but
    # implementations are only required to match this ideal for horizontal and
    # vertical lines. Failing the ideal semantics, it is suggested that the length
    # be measured along the major axis of the line. The major axis is defined as
    # the x axis for lines drawn at an angle of between -45 and +45 degrees or
    # between 135 and 225 degrees from the x axis. For all other lines, the major axis is the y axis.

    # Changes the input focus and the last-focus-change time.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **focus** Specifies the window, **PointerRoot**, or **None**.
    # - **revert_to** Specifies where the input focus reverts to if the window
    # becomes not viewable. You can pass **RevertToParent**,
    # **RevertToPointerRoot**, or **RevertToNone**.
    # - **time** Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp or **CurrentTime**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `set_input_focus` function changes the input focus and the
    # last-focus-change time. It has no effect if the specified time is earlier
    # than the current last-focus-change time or is later than the current X
    # server time. Otherwise, the last-focus-change time is set to the specified
    # time (**CurrentTime** is replaced by the current X server time).
    # `set_input_focus` causes the X server to generate **FocusIn** and **FocusOut** events.
    #
    # Depending on the focus argument, the following occurs:
    # - If focus is **None**, all keyboard events are discarded until a new focus
    # window is set, and the revert_to argument is ignored.
    # - If focus is a window, it becomes the keyboard's focus window. If a generated
    # keyboard event would normally be reported to this window or one of its inferiors,
    # the event is reported as usual. Otherwise, the event is reported relative to the focus window.
    # - If focus is **PointerRoot**, the focus window is dynamically taken to be
    # the root window of whatever screen the pointer is on at each keyboard event.
    # In this case, the revert_to argument is ignored.
    #
    # The specified focus window must be viewable at the time `set_input_focus`
    # is called, or a **BadMatch** error results. If the focus window later
    # becomes not viewable, the X server evaluates the revert_to argument to
    # determine the new focus window as follows:
    # - If revert_to is **RevertToParent**, the focus reverts to the parent
    # (or the closest viewable ancestor), and the new revert_to value is taken to be **RevertToNone**.
    # - If revert_to is **RevertToPointerRoot** or **RevertToNone**, the focus
    # reverts to **PointerRoot** or **None**, respectively. When the focus reverts,
    # the X server generates **FocusIn** and **FocusOut** events,
    # but the last-focus-change time is not affected.
    #
    # `set_input_focus` can generate **BadMatch**, **BadValue**, and **BadWindow** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
    # range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and

    # Specifies the KeyCodes of the keys that are to be used as modifiers.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **modmap** Specifies the `ModifierKeymap` structure.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `set_modifier_mapping` function specifies the KeyCodes of the keys
    # (if any) that are to be used as modifiers. If it succeeds, the X server
    # generates a **MappingNotify** event, and `set_modifier_mapping` returns
    # **MappingSuccess**. X permits at most eight modifier keys. If more than
    # eight are specified in the `ModifierKeymap` structure, a **BadLength** error results.
    #
    # The modifiermap member of the `ModifierKeymap` structure contains eight sets
    # of max_keypermod KeyCodes, one for each modifier in the order **Shift**,
    # **Lock**, **Control**, **Mod1**, **Mod2**, **Mod3**, **Mod4**, and **Mod5**.
    # Only nonzero KeyCodes have meaning in each set, and zero KeyCodes are ignored.
    # In addition, all of the nonzero KeyCodes must be in the range specified by
    # min_keycode and max_keycode in the `Display` object, or a **BadValue** error results.
    #
    # An X server can impose restrictions on how modifiers can be changed, for
    # example, if certain keys do not generate up transitions in hardware, if
    # auto-repeat cannot be disabled on certain keys, or if multiple modifier keys
    # are not supported. If some such restriction is violated, the status reply is
    # **MappingFailed**, and none of the modifiers are changed. If the new KeyCodes
    # specified for a modifier differ from those currently defined and any
    # (current or new) keys for that modifier are in the logically down state,
    # `set_modifier_mapping` returns **MappingBusy**, and none of the modifiers is changed.
    #
    # `set_modifier_mapping` can generate **BadAlloc** and **BadValue** errors.

    # Sets the mapping of the pointer.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **map** Specifies the mapping list.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `set_pointer_mapping` function sets the mapping of the pointer. If it
    # succeeds, the X server generates a **MappingNotify** event, and
    # `set_pointer_mapping` returns **MappingSuccess**. Element map[i] defines
    # the logical button number for the physical button i+1. The length of the
    # list must be the same as `pointer_mapping` would return, or a **BadValue**
    # error results. A zero element disables a button, and elements are not
    # restricted in value by the number of physical buttons. However, no two
    # elements can have the same nonzero value, or a **BadValue** error results.
    # If any of the buttons to be altered are logically in the down state,
    # `set_pointer_mapping` returns **MappingBusy**, and the mapping is not changed.
    #
    # `set_pointer_mapping` can generate a **BadValue** error.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadValue** Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted

    # Sets the screen saver mode.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **timeout** Specifies the timeout, in seconds, until the screen saver turns on.
    # - **interval* Specifies the interval, in seconds, between screen saver alterations.
    # - **prefer_blanking** Specifies how to enable screen blanking. You can pass
    # **DontPreferBlanking**, **PreferBlanking**, or **DefaultBlanking**.
    # - **allow_exposures** Specifies the screen save control values. You can pass
    # **DontAllowExposures**, **AllowExposures**, or **DefaultExposures**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # Timeout and interval are specified in seconds. A timeout of 0 disables the
    # screen saver (but an activated screen saver is not deactivated), and a
    # timeout of -1 restores the default. Other negative values generate a
    # **BadValue** error. If the timeout value is nonzero, `set_screen_saver`
    # enables the screen saver. An interval of 0 disables the random-pattern motion.
    # If no input from devices (keyboard, mouse, and so on) is generated for the
    # specified number of timeout seconds once the screen saver is enabled, the screen saver is activated.
    #
    # For each screen, if blanking is preferred and the hardware supports video
    # blanking, the screen simply goes blank. Otherwise, if either exposures are
    # allowed or the screen can be regenerated without sending **Expose** events
    # to clients, the screen is tiled with the root window background tile randomly
    # re-origined each interval seconds. Otherwise, the screens' state do not change,
    # and the screen saver is not activated. The screen saver is deactivated, and
    # all screen states are restored at the next keyboard or pointer input or at the
    # next call to `force_screen_saver` with mode **ScreenSaverReset**.
    #
    # If the server-dependent screen saver method supports periodic change, the
    # interval argument serves as a hint about how long the change period should
    # be, and zero hints that no periodic change should be made. Examples of ways
    # to change the screen include scrambling the colormap periodically, moving an
    # icon image around the screen periodically, or tiling the screen with the
    # root window background tile, randomly re-origined periodically.
    #
    # `set_screen_saver` can generate a **BadValue** error.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics

    # ###Arguments
    # - **selection** Specifies the selection atom.
    # - **owner** Specifies the owner of the specified selection atom. You can pass a window or **None**.
    # - **time** Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp or **CurrentTime**.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `set_selection_owner` function changes the owner and last-change time
    # for the specified selection and has no effect if the specified time is
    # earlier than the current last-change time of the specified selection or is
    # later than the current X server time. Otherwise, the last-change time is
    # set to the specified time, with **CurrentTime** replaced by the current
    # server time. If the owner window is specified as **None**, then the owner
    # of the selection becomes **None** (that is, no owner). Otherwise, the
    # owner of the selection becomes the client executing the request.
    #
    # If the new owner (whether a client or **None**) is not the same as the
    # current owner of the selection and the current owner is not **None**,
    # the current owner is sent a **SelectionClear** event. If the client that
    # is the owner of a selection is later terminated (that is, its connection
    # is closed) or if the owner window it has specified in the request is later
    # destroyed, the owner of the selection automatically reverts to **None**,
    # but the last-change time is not affected. The selection atom is
    # uninterpreted by the X server. `selection_owner` returns the owner window,
    # which is reported in **SelectionRequest** and **SelectionClear** events.
    # Selections are global to the X server.
    #
    # `set_selection_owner` can generate **BadAtom** and **BadWindow** errors.

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `set_window_background` function sets the background of the window to
    # the specified pixel value. Changing the background does not cause the window
    # contents to be changed. `set_window_background` uses a pixmap of undefined
    # size filled with the pixel value you passed. If you try to change the
    # background of an **InputOnly** window, a **BadMatch** error results.
    #
    # `set_window_background` can generate **BadMatch** and **BadWindow** errors.
    #
    # Note `set_window_background` and `set_window_background_pixmap` do not
    # change the current contents of the window.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*.
    # - **BadMatch** Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and
    # range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `sync` function flushes the output buffer and then waits until all

    # generated must be handled by the error handler. For each protocol error
    # received by Xlib, `sync` calls the client application's error handling
    # routine (see "Using the Default Error Handlers"). Any events generated by
    # the server are enqueued into the library's event queue.
    #
    # Finally, if you passed **false**, `sync` does not discard the events in
    # the queue. If you passed **true**, `sync` discards all events in the queue,
    # including those events that were on the queue before `sync` was called.

    # ###Description
    # The `uninstall_colormap` function removes the specified colormap from the
    # required list for its screen. As a result, the specified colormap might be

    # additional colormaps. Which colormaps get installed or uninstalled is
    # server-dependent except that the required list must remain installed.
    #
    # If the specified colormap becomes uninstalled, the X server generates a
    # **ColormapNotify** event on each window that has that colormap. In
    # addition, for every other colormap that is installed or uninstalled as a
    # result of a call to `uninstall_colormap`, the X server generates a
    # **ColormapNotify** event on each window that has that colormap.
    #
    # `uninstall_colormap` can generate a **BadColor** error.

    # ###Description
    # The `unmap_subwindows` function unmaps all subwindows for the specified
    # window in bottom-to-top stacking order. It causes the X server to generate
    # an **UnmapNotify** event on each subwindow and **Expose** events on formerly
    # obscured windows. Using this function is much more efficient than unmapping
    # multiple windows one at a time because the server needs to perform much of
    # the work only once, for all of the windows, rather than for each window.
    #
    # `unmap_subwindows` can generate a **BadWindow** error.

    # ###Description
    # The `unmap_window` function unmaps the specified window and causes the X
    # server to generate an **UnmapNotify** event. If the specified window is
    # already unmapped, `unmap_window` has no effect. Normal exposure processing
    # on formerly obscured windows is performed. Any child window will no longer
    # be visible until another map call is made on the parent. In other words,
    # the subwindows are still mapped but are not visible until the parent is
    # mapped. Unmapping a window will generate **Expose** events on windows that were formerly obscured by it.

    # Moves the pointer by the offsets relative to the current position of the pointer.
    #
    # ###Arguments
    # - **src_w** Specifies the source window or **None**.
    # - **dest_w** Specifies the destination window or **None**.
    # - **src_x**, **src_y**, **src_width**, **src_height** Specify a rectangle in the source window.
    # - **dest_x**, **dest_y** Specify the x and y coordinates within the destination window.
    #
    # ###Description
    # If dest_w is **None**, `warp_pointer` moves the pointer by the offsets
    # (dest_x, dest_y) relative to the current position of the pointer.
    # If dest_w is a window, `warp_pointer` moves the pointer to the offsets
    # (dest_x, dest_y) relative to the origin of dest_w. However, if src_w is a
    # window, the move only takes place if the window src_w contains the pointer
    # and if the specified rectangle of src_w contains the pointer.
    #
    # The src_x and src_y coordinates are relative to the origin of src_w. If
    # src_height is zero, it is replaced with the current height of src_w minus
    # src_y. If src_width is zero, it is replaced with the current width of src_w minus src_x.
    #
    # There is seldom any reason for calling this function. The pointer should
    # normally be left to the user. If you do use this function, however, it
    # generates events just as if the user had instantaneously moved the
    # pointer from one position to another. Note that you cannot use `warp_pointer`
    # to move the pointer outside the confine_to window of an active pointer grab.
    # An attempt to do so will only move the pointer as far as the closest edge of the confine_to window.
    #
    # `warp_pointer` can generate a **BadWindow** error.

    # ###Arguments
    # - **w** Specifies the window whose events you are interested in.

    #
    # ###Description
    # The `window_event` function searches the event queue for an event that

    # discarded. If a matching event is not in the queue, `window_event`
    # flushes the output buffer and blocks until one is received.

    # Writes a bitmap out to a file in the X Version 11 format.

    # - **filename** Specifies the file name to use. The format of the file name is operating-system dependent.
    # - **bitmap** Specifies the bitmap.
    # - **width**, **height** Specify the width and height.
    # - **x_hot**, **y_hot** Specify where to place the hotspot coordinates
    # (or -1, -1 if none are present) in the file.
    #
    # ###Description
    # The `write_bitmap_file` function writes a bitmap out to a file in the X
    # Version 11 format. The name used in the output file is derived from the
    # file name by deleting the directory prefix. The file is written in the
    # encoding of the current locale. If the file cannot be opened for writing,
    # it returns **BitmapOpenFailed**. If insufficient memory is allocated,
    # `write_bitmap_file` returns **BitmapNoMemory**; otherwise, on no error,
    # it returns **BitmapSuccess**. If x_hot and y_hot are not -1, -1,
    # `write_bitmap_file` writes them out as the hotspot coordinates for the bitmap.
    #
    # `write_bitmap_file` can generate **BadDrawable** and **BadMatch** errors.
    #
    # ###Diagnostics
    # - **BadDrawable** A value for a *Drawable* argument does not name a defined *Window* or *Pixmap*.
    # - **BadMatch** An **InputOnly** window is used as a *Drawable*. **BadMatch**.
